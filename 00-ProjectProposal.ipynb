    "Mental health concerns among college students have increased in recent years, with rising reports of anxiety and depression, coupled with the growth of social media platforms. Because most students engage with social networking sites daily, researchers have become interested in understanding whether online behavior plays a role in psychological well-being. While early discussions often focused on the amount of time spent online, more recent work has shifted toward examining the quality and consequences of social media use, including whether the behavior is compulsive, causes interpersonal conflict, or interferes with daily life. \n",

    "Social media use is extremely common among college students, but researchers now separate how much people use social platforms (time or frequency) from how they use them (such as compulsive or conflict-driven behavior). “Problematic social media use,” also described as social media addiction, refers to patterns that are hard to control and that disrupt daily life.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup> This distinction matters for our project because the dataset includes both an addiction-like score and relationship-focused variables, such as conflicts. This lets us examine whether problematic use is linked to worse mental health outcomes beyond what can be explained by time spent on social media alone.Do you like this personality?\n",

    "Prior research consistently shows that higher levels of problematic social media use are linked to poorer mental health outcomes, including higher depression and anxiety symptoms and lower overall well-being.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup>2</sup><a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a><sup>3</sup> However, many studies emphasize that causality is unclear and that these effects may depend on individual or social factors. One systematic review of adolescents and young adults found widespread links between problematic use and depression and stress, but noted that most studies were cross-sectional and therefore could not determine whether social media use leads to poorer mental health or vice versa.<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a><sup>2</sup> Public health reports argue that risks cannot be captured by screen time alone and that the type of engagement and harmful experiences matter more than total time spent online.<a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a><sup>4</sup> These findings motivate two directions for our study: first, testing whether addiction-like measures of social media use are associated with mental health and whether that association varies by gender or academic level, and second, examining whether conflict-related experiences predict poorer mental health even after controlling for total usage time and relationship status.\n",

Many studies assess problematic social media use using validated tools such as the Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS), which is based on core addiction features like salience, mood modification, tolerance, withdrawal, conflict, and relapse.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup> Validation studies show that the BSMAS has a stable structure and can reliably measure problematic use in young populations, making it useful for studying links with mental health and related outcomes.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a><sup>1</sup> Although our Kaggle dataset uses its own addiction score, this work helps clarify what this measure is intended to capture. \n",
    "\n",

    "Because one potential research direction focuses specifically on interpersonal conflict and relationship factors, earlier work on romantic and social relationships is especially relevant. Studies of college students and young adults have found that heavier social media use is associated with relationship strain.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a><sup>5</sup><a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a><sup>6</sup> In particular, Clayton et al. reported that greater Facebook use was linked to worse relationship outcomes especially in newer relationships.<a name=\"cite_ref-5\"></a><sup>5</sup> Other research on “Facebook intrusion” reported similar connections between intrusive use, jealousy, and reduced satisfaction in undergraduate romantic relationships.<a name=\"cite_ref-6\"></a><sup>6</sup> These results support our plan to examine whether conflicts over social media predict lower mental health scores, even after accounting for usage time and relationship status.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, prior studies suggest that the relationship between problematic technology use and well-being can differ across demographic groups, which motivates our future analyses by gender and academic level. Research on smartphone addiction among undergraduates, for example, has reported gender differences in prevalence and associated factors, implying that risks and outcomes may not be the same for everyone.<a name=\"cite_ref-7\"></a><sup>7</sup> Therefore, one possible research question for this study is whether the association between social media addiction scores and mental health differs by gender or academic level, rather than assuming a single overall effect for all students.\n",

    "We predict that there is a statistically significant relationship between social media addiction and mental health score, clearly differing by gender and academic level. In fact, several signs of bad mental health such as detachment of reality and excess fear or worry are commly attributed to the growing and prevasive social media algorithms. When considering the influence of targeted post against users of certain academic level and promoted gender conformity, it is no surprising to exist intersectionality between these set of elements."

    "**Ideal Dataset:**\n",
    "To answer whether social media addiction is related to mental health and whether that relationship differs by gender or academic level, the ideal dataset for our project would be student-level survey data that includes a validated measure of social media addiction, a validated measure of mental health, demographic information on gender, and a clear indicator of academic level such as year in school or undergraduate versus graduate status. We would also want a few important background variables that could affect both social media use and mental health, such as age, typical daily time spent on social media, sleep habits, and basic school or location context so we can account for major differences across groups. In terms of sample size, we need enough students in each gender and academic-level group to reliably detect differences in the relationship, so several hundred students at minimum and ideally closer to one thousand or more is a strong target, especially if group sizes are uneven. These data would ideally be collected through a standardized survey distributed across multiple schools or through stratified sampling to ensure representation across genders and academic levels, using consistent scoring procedures and a documented codebook. We would store the data in a clean, organized table where each row represents one student and each column represents one variable, with clear variable definitions, consistent handling of missing values, and documentation explaining how the addiction and mental health scores were computed and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset 1 ([Link 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships)):**\n",
    "This dataset is hosted on Kaggle under the title “Students’ Social Media Addiction,” and we would need a Kaggle account to accept the dataset’s terms and download the CSV file for analysis. It includes variables that map directly onto our research question, including an addiction score, a mental health score, gender, and academic level, along with related factors like average daily usage, sleep per night, and other context variables such as platform, relationship status, and social media conflicts. Using this dataset, we could model mental health as a function of addiction and then test whether the strength of that relationship changes across gender and academic level, while optionally controlling for usage and sleep. This makes it a strong match for the full set of analyses we want to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset 2 ([Link 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zahranusratt/student-social-media-addiction-analysis-dataset)):**\n",
    "This Kaggle dataset also provides a CSV titled “Students Social Media Addiction.csv,” and we would similarly need Kaggle access and to download the file before we can use it. Public writeups and analyses of this same CSV indicate it contains about 705 rows and 13 columns, and the core fields include gender, academic level, mental health score, and addiction score, plus usage and lifestyle variables such as daily usage and sleep. Functionally, it supports the same main tests we want, including estimating the overall relationship between addiction and mental health and checking whether that relationship differs across subgroups. It is also useful for comparing our results against existing Kaggle notebooks or replications that use the same file structure.\n",

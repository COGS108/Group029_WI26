    "### Students social media use, addiction score, and relationship factors survey \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is a cross sectional student survey with 705 responses and 13 variables that describe demographics, daily social media habits, sleep, mental health ratings, academics, and relationship conflict tied to social media. Each row corresponds to one student, and Student_ID appears to be an anonymized identifier rather than personally identifying information. The respondents are mostly in the late teen to young adult range, roughly ages 16 to 25, so the dataset is best interpreted as a snapshot of student experiences rather than a general population sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important metrics are the measures of time use, well being, and conflict. Avg_Daily_Usage_Hours is in hours per day and reflects how much time a student spends on social media on a typical day. Sleep_Hours_Per_Night is in hours per night and gives a sense of sleep quantity. For context, public health guidance for adults is generally at least 7 hours of sleep per night. The dataset also includes Mental_Health_Score, commonly described in public summaries as a 1 to 10 self rating, and an Addicted_Score that is also treated in some analyses as a 1 to 10 severity style scale. Conflicts_Over_Social_Media is used as a small count or short scale of how often social media is linked to relationship disagreements. Categorical fields such as Gender, Academic_Level, Relationship_Status, Most_Used_Platform, Country, and Affects_Academic_Performance make it possible to compare these outcomes across groups and to look for patterns like heavier use being associated with lower sleep or more reported conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few major concerns to keep in mind. First, nearly all variables are self reported, so usage hours, sleep, mental health, and addiction severity can be affected by memory errors and by how comfortable someone is reporting honestly. Second, the data are cross sectional, meaning they capture one point in time, so you can study associations but you cannot say social media use causes changes in mental health, sleep, or relationship conflict. Third, the sample is likely shaped by who chose to respond, so it may not be representative of all students, and responses across countries can differ based on culture and how people interpret rating scales. Finally, some public writeups describe the score ranges slightly differently, so it is safer to verify the actual distributions directly in the dataset before using strict cutoffs or treating the scales as standardized clinical measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary Statistics for Key Variables \n",
    "\n",
    "#### For this project, the most important variables relate to:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Addiction Score**: The mean addiction score is X, with values ranging from Y to Z. Higher scores indicate stronger signs of problematic social media use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Daily Usage Hours**: Participants spend an average of X hours per day on social media, suggesting moderate/high usage in the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship Satisfaction**: The average satisfaction score is X, indicating generally moderate/high relationship quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conflict Frequency**: The distribution shows whether conflict levels are typically low or elevated.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age**: Provides context about the demographic makeup of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### These variables are important because:\n",
    "\n",
    "Addiction score is the **primary predictor**\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship satisfaction/conflict are the **primary outcomes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Usage hours helps validate addiction scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Age may act as a **confounder**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### These variables directly relate to our research question examining the association between social media addiction and relationship quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions: \n",
    "1. Change the header from Dataset #1 to something more descriptive of the dataset\n",
    "2. Write a few paragraphs about this dataset. Make sure to cover\n",
    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",
    "3. Use the cell below to \n",
    "    1. load the dataset \n",
    "    2. make the dataset tidy or demonstrate that it was already tidy\n",
    "    3. demonstrate the size of the dataset\n",
    "    4. find out how much data is missing, where its missing, and if its missing at random or seems to have any systematic relationships in its missingness\n",
    "    5. find and flag any outliers or suspicious entries\n",
    "    6. clean the data or demonstrate that it was already clean.  You may choose how to deal with missingness (dropna of fillna... how='any' or 'all') and you should justify your choice in some way\n",
    "    7. You will load raw data from `data/00-raw/`, you will (optionally) write intermediate stages of your work to `data/01-interim` and you will write the final fully wrangled version of your data to `data/02-processed`\n",
    "4. Optionally you can also show some summary statistics for variables that you think are important to the project\n",
    "5. Feel free to add more cells here if that's helpful for you\n"
